# UniverseAGH

UniverseAGH is an interactive map built entirely from scratch. It allows users to pan, zoom in, and zoom out seamlessly. The map is designed using SVG technology and dynamically manages objects based on their size and zoom level. It also avoids rendering objects that are outside the visible screen area.

## Features
- **Dynamic Object Management**: Automatically adds or removes objects based on zoom level and visibility.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Smooth panning and zooming capabilities.
- **Search Functionality**: Locate buildings, campuses, dormitories, and more.
- **Pathfinding**: Calculate and display the shortest paths between selected points on the map using lines.

## How to Use
1. Open the interactive map.
2. Use the controls to navigate, zoom, and search for specific locations.
3. Add points on the map to calculate and visualize the shortest routes between them.

## Requirements
- Tested only on Google Chrome (desktop). It might be buggy in other environments.
- Internet connection.
